# Igor in the Pi 🦍

Igor's operating repository: identity, memory scaffolding, systems, and automations.

## Purpose

This repo is the working brain/home for Igor:
- Personality + operating constraints
- Human context
- Long-term and daily memory structure
- Playbooks for product execution and trading development
- Automation templates (heartbeat/cron prompts)

## Structure

- `core/` — stable identity and operating profile snapshots
- `memory/` — daily notes (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) and heartbeat state
- `systems/` — playbooks and SOPs (product, trading, ops)
- `automations/` — cron and recurring-task templates
- `docs/` — reference docs and setup notes

## Notes

Runtime-critical files still live at repo root for OpenClaw compatibility:
- `SOUL.md`
- `USER.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `TOOLS.md`
- `HEARTBEAT.md`
